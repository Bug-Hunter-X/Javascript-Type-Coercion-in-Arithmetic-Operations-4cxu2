This example demonstrates a common error in Javascript related to type coercion.  When using the + operator with a mix of numbers and strings, Javascript will perform string concatenation instead of numerical addition. This can lead to unexpected results if not handled carefully. The solution demonstrates how to explicitly type check or convert the variables to ensure correct arithmetic behavior.
